Uploading the custom crossed line styling in XML format enhances the flexibility of geospatial data representation. By defining the alternating black and white segments through XML-based Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) specifications, you can achieve a distinct railway line appearance. This approach empowers GIS systems to accurately render the unique crossed pattern, adding visual clarity and significance to the representation of railway features in maps and geospatial applications.
A crossed line style, expressed in XML code using the Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) specification, involves the representation of a line with intersecting black and white segments. By utilizing graphics and stroke parameters within the SLD structure, this style creates a visual effect reminiscent of a dashed line pattern, with alternating black and white colors, allowing for distinctive and recognizable railway line depiction in geospatial data visualizations.
